# Stellar Visualizer

## Introduction

Stellar Visualizer:

1. Generates synthetic data in the style of Gaia data.
2. Visualizes data (synthetic or real) given in CSV format in 3D, with various interactive options for data exploration.

The folder structure is as follows:

`Generate`: Code relating to the generation of synthetic data

`________/generate_synthetic_data.py`: `Python3` script which generates synthetic data

`Visualize`: Code relating to the visualization of data (synthetic or real)

`________/`: *WIP*

## Getting started

Install the [Node Package Manager](http://npmjs.com/) (NPM) if you don't already have it.  Then, in the working directory, run:

````
npm install
````

If successful, you should see something more or less like this in your shell:

````
~/stellarVisualizer(master*) » npm install
stellar_visualizer@1.0.0 your_name/stellarVisualizer
└─┬ vis@4.21.0
  ├── emitter-component@1.1.1
  ├── hammerjs@2.0.8
  ├── keycharm@0.2.0
  ├── moment@2.20.1
  └── propagating-hammerjs@1.4.6
````

## Status

The synthetic data generation tool is *WIP*.  Once that is completed, I will begin working on the visualization code in Javascript and further documentation.
