# Stellar Visualizer

## Introduction

Stellar Visualizer:

1. Generates synthetic data in the style of Gaia data.
2. Visualizes data (synthetic or real) given in CSV format in 3D, with various interactive options for data exploration.

The folder structure is as follows:

`Generate`: Code relating to the generation of synthetic data

* `________/generate_synthetic_data.py`: `Python3` script which generates synthetic data

`Visualize`: Code relating to the visualization of data (synthetic or real)

* `________/index.html`: `HTML` boilerplate for visualization output
* `________/index.js`: `Javascript` code for interactivity on visualization output

## Getting started

Install the [Node Package Manager](http://npmjs.com/) (NPM) if you don't already have it.  Then, in the working directory, run:

````
npm install
````

(More documentation coming on how to actually use the code.)

## Status

The synthetic data generation tool is *WIP*.  Once that is completed, I will begin working on the visualization code in Javascript and further documentation.

This section will get cleaned up and made more science-y and formal and whatnot later.  For now, we only have one reference, [which is this](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1987AJ.....93..864J).
