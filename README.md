# Stellar Visualizer

## Introduction

Stellar Visualizer:

1. Generates synthetic data in the style of Gaia data.
2. Visualizes data (synthetic or real) given in CSV format in 3D, with various interactive options for data exploration.

## Status

The synthetic data generation tool is WIP.  Once that is completed, I will begin working on the visualization code in Javascript and further documentation.

## Attribution

This project relies on the following open-source tools:

1. [VisJS](http://visjs.org) is used to draw 3D graphs like [this one](http://visjs.org/examples/graph3d/playground/index.html).
